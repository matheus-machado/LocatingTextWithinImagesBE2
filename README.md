# LocatingTextWithinImagesBE2

First step: you must run the code interface.m to acess the parameters and choose the desired image to be analyzed
Remember to add to path all the folders and subfolders that contains the images and codes
The main code is in BE2_JCR, but all the parameters are sent by GUI (the inferface), thats why you need first to run interface.m.
You don't need to change any line code, only the slide bars parameters.
